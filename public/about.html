<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a first-year undergraduate student at IIT Delhi, pursuing Mechanical Engineering, I bring with me an insatiable curiosity and a passion for exploring diverse disciplinesâ€”both technical and creative. Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in NSS and BloodConnect, where I contribute to impactful community initiatives and social awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>I enjoy expressing myself through painting and photography, and in my downtime, I find joy in gardening, travelling, and playing badminton. Each of these passions fuels my desire to connect with people, understand different perspectives, and make a tangible difference in the world around me.</p>
<p>With three transformative years ahead at IIT Delhi, I aim to explore interdisciplinary learning, contribute meaningfully to my community, and continue evolving as a responsible, skilled, and socially aware individual.</p>
